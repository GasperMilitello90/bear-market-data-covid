# bear-market-data-covid

Using Excel, I pulled historical stock data from two major sectors - Tech and Healthcare. Using this data, I created pivot tables and graphs to detail the volatility of prices during the pandemic. From February to March the stocks I analyzed dropped 13.90% on average. Prices quickly rebounded in April, which means this was one of the shortest Bear Markets of all time.
